## [ALPHA] HunterVsSpeedrunner

### Disclaimer: I am not developing this anymore, but I may come back to it. This plugin will probably not work right, especially when people log on and off in the middle of the game. That is why I put in so many debug commands, so feel free to utilize them while playing.

A Minecraft 1.17.1 Spigot plugin created for my friends and me to play.<br>
All inspiration goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/dream">Dream</a>, who came up with the concept.<br>

1. /hunter <name> - sets specified player (or command sender) to the hunter role and provides a compass

3. /clearRoles - clears the roles for every player
4. /remmoveHunter <name> - removes player from the hunter role
